# UDP Midi Server 

## Command line server and client.

### Client works as a subscriber, and a broadcaster.

## Broadcast to server, and subscribe to server using different system.

Currently wrapping up process of multiplexing the original system, which provided proof of concept.

# Under Implementation:

Commandline interface allows for negotiation of midi input and output devices, as well as hotloading Broadcasts and Subscriptions from running client.

Server Interface for managing connections and negotiation of subscriptions and broadcasters.

## Documentation to follow initial release of basic functionality.



# Warning : 

## Currently no security whatsoever.

### It would be nice to have a version that is secure, but more important to have a version as fast as possible to allow for maximum studio flexibility.
